title = "Emperor "
name = "Johnson "
command = "likes to eat a lot of cake, which is why he is fat and has diabetes alothough he has a personal doctor so he should be fine but i am not even sure if he will be fine because diabetes is quite hard to treat and he might actually die form diabetes. After that, his son will inherit the throne and become the king and continue to eat a lot of cake and get diabetes and the cycle therefore continues."
